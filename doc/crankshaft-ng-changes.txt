*** Check the new wiki section on github about Crankshaft NG ***
*** The wiki will be updated step by step next time ***

- New buildsystem based on pi-gen
- Redesign system with systemd, startup service deps,timers etc. - no more sleep times in scripts
- Usage of plymouth for splash during boot/shutdown
- New crankshaft management tool for most default cases like setup of rtc, rpi cam, hifiberry boards,
    easy usb mounts etc. etc. - have a look to the command 'crankshaft' in shell
- Day/night switchable for gui and reflected to android auto / can auto switch by rtc
  (default 8-18 Day)
- Splitted brightness control and restore for both states (day/night)
- Clock for gui added
- System updates via usb stick - place file on stick and auto flash sd card during boot!
    Update file (img) must be placed on 1st partition with it's corosponding md5 file.
    Optionally you can put downloaded zip to the stick which will be auto unpacked - make sure
    enough space is available.
    Crankshaft settings etc. will be safed and restored during flash.
    Gui will show a kodi icon if /usr/bin/kodi exists to start it.
    But respect: no official support for kodi usage with crankshaft it's only a small gift :-)
- Rework shutdown menu - shutdown and reboot available
- Including rpi cam as dashcam or rearcam cause low resources needed from os.
    Usb cams possible needs transconding and causes high cpu load so no good decision.
    To extend the flat cable from cam hdmi extenders are available and working well!
    If a usb storage (partition 1) called "CSSTORAGE" is detected it will be auto mounted and used for dashcam and kodi home folder.
    Events can be saved by button press in dashcam window (last recorded file will we saved with different name in EVENTS)
    By default every recording file will have a length of 5 mins after it a new file is created.
    Free available storage is shown in dashcam window.
- Rearcam can be triggered externally to show/hide by placing (or remove) file /tmp/rearcam_enabled
    Rearcam can also be activated via toogle button in dashcam window or by gpio service.
    Rearcam can triggered via gpio.
- Screen timeouts: redesigned to two timers.
    First:  Shutdown timer if no connected device for auto shutdown the rpi.
            Default 60 mins.
            (Stopped and resetted by device connect / disconnect)
            It can be disabled via crankshaft_env.sh or settings in gui.
    Second: Screentimeout if no connected device.
            Default 120 seconds - on first boot 300 seconds.
            (Stopped and resetted by device connect / disconnect)
            It can be disabled via crankshaft_env.sh or settings in gui.
    Hint:   In dev mode no timers are activated so no auto shutdown or screen timeout!
- Tap2Wake: If screen has reached timeout it can be waked up by tap to display or keypress on input device
- Dev Mode reworked
    Dev mode can be activated in crankshaft_env.sh, by gpio if general gpio usage is activated or by usb stick!
    to activate dev mode by usb stick place a file called "ENABLE_DEVMODE" on first partition of a usb stick.
    It will be auto detected during boot.
- Wifi client in dev mode:
    Wfi ssid and psk can be set in crankshaft_env.sh to allow system to auto connect to this network and grant ssh access
    and system management.
- Wifi hotspot in dev mode:
    a hotspot can be enbled in crankshaft_env.sh which is opened in dev mode to allow ssh access
    and system management.
    Hint: the hotspot is working in router mode using eth0 as uplink on the rpi. So you can get inet access if eth0 is connected
    to wired network (auto config via dhcp from lan)
    Note: if hotspot is used, system can't be wifi client!
- Android device detection via udev optimized and device list updateable (let us know if some manufacturer is missing!)
    GPIO can be set if device connected to switch exernal parts.
- Optimized settings menu (slider size / textboxes)
- New CS-NG tabs in settings with system infos etc.
- System volume and capture volume control added (experimental)
- External rw storage: If a usb drive which is labeled "CSSTORAGE" is detected it will be mountet rw for kodi home folder and dashcam storage.
