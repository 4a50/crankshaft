"Social Contract" with the Free Software Community
==


Crankshaft will remain 100% free
--

We provide the guidelines that we use to determine if a work is "free" in the document entitled "[The Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract)". We promise that the Crankshaft system and all its components will be free according to these guidelines. We will support people who create or use both free and non-free works on Crankshaft. We will never make the system require the use of a non-free component.

We will give back to the free software community
--

When we write new components of the Crankshaft system, we will license them in a manner consistent with the Debian Free Software Guidelines. We will make the best system we can, so that free works will be widely distributed and used. We will communicate things such as bug fixes, improvements and user requests to the "upstream" authors of works included in our system.

We will not hide problems
--

We will keep our entire bug report database open for public view at all times. Reports that people file online will promptly become visible to others.

Our priorities are our users and free software
--

We will be guided by the needs of our users and the free software community. We will place their interests first in our priorities. We will support the needs of our users for operation in many different kinds of computing environments. We will not object to non-free works that are intended to be used on Crankshaft systems, or attempt to charge a fee to people who create or use such works. We will allow others to create distributions containing both the Crankshaft system and other works, without any fee from us. In furtherance of these goals, we will provide an integrated system of high-quality materials with no legal restrictions that would prevent such uses of the system.

Works that do not meet our free software standards
--

We acknowledge that some of our users require the use of works that do not conform to the Debian Free Software Guidelines. The packages in these areas are not part of the Crankshaft system, although they have been configured for use with Crankshaft and will never be required for a base Crankshaft system to work.

We will clearly indicate affiliations and conflicts of interest
--

Links and suggestions for hardware, software and features on the Crankshaft system should clearly indicate affiliation if there is an affiliation, comission, or conflict of interest between any contributing member and the suggested entity.

We will clearly indicate privacy-sensitive features
--

If any component of Crankshaft wishes to send back user data, it must not do so as a default, or be suggested as a default. It should succinctly describe what kinds of data that it collects, how is the data encrypted, and to what parties it gives access of the data to in less than 100 words of text.


Changes made to this contract
--

If there is any change made to this social contract, it should be agreed upon between all members of the steering committee, and then be clearly indicate what changes are made and when.
